# Machine-Learning-for-a-Marketing-Campaign

**Author:**

I am Álvaro Orgaz Expósito, a data science student at KTH (Stockholm, Sweden) and a statistician from UPC-UB (Barcelona, Spain).

**Abstract:** 

This repository contains some popular algorithms of Machine Learning coded in a simple handmade way from scratch in R. The aim of this project is not to optimize or overcome already implemented algorithms in R libraries, but rather the aim should be learning the essence of their structure in a didactical way whatever your level is.

The main aims of this project are:
- Preprocessing and exploratory data analysis of a dataset with customer characteristics for a marketign campaign
- Apply unsupervised ML algorithms for develeping the exploratory data analysis
- Apply supervised ML algorithms for predicting the probability of being good customer and comparing the predictive behaviour between models

The project has been developed in R Markdown.
